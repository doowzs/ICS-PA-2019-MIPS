# ICS2019 Programming Assignment (MIPS ISA)

## Repository Description

This is the copy of [Tianyun Zhang](https://doowzs.com)'s work on ICS PA 2019. The repository can be accessed at the following addresses:

- Private: [https://git.doowzs.com/doowzs/ics-pa-2019-mips](https://git.doowzs.com/doowzs/ics-pa-2019-mips)
- Public: [https://github.com/doowzs/ICS-PA-2019-MIPS](https://github.com/doowzs/ICS-PA-2019-MIPS)

In order to contribute to academic integrity and prevent plagiarizing, only the `master` branch is mirrored from the private repository to the public repository. The `master` branch would be pushed after the deadline of each stage. However, the implementation notes of all PA quests are publicly visible at [https://doowzs.com/docs/50-pa-plus/](https://doowzs.com/docs/50-pa-plus/).
